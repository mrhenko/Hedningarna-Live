Hedningarna Live
================

This is a collection of utitilies used by the swedish band [__Hedningarna__][1] in their live performances.

When playing live Hedningarna uses *Ableton Live* to run their click track, backing tracks and apply FX processing to their instruments. These utilities are [Max4Live][2] devices and [Touch OSC][3] layouts created to enable the musicians to easily get a view of the currently playing backing track, status on FX processors etc. in their iPhones.
